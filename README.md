# Deepcode plugin for IDE "Eclipse"

# DeepCode extension

Through the extension you can quickly start using DeepCode's code review and analysis within your development workflow. The extension will automatically alert you about critical vulnerabilities you need to solve in your code the moment when you hit _Save_ in your IDE. With DeepCode's superior code review you save time finding and fixing bugs before they go to production. 

## DeepCode's AI Engine finds bugs

DeepCode uses symbolic AI to process hundreds of millions of commits in open source software projects and learns how to find serious coding issues. Because the platform determines the intent of the code — and not only the syntax mistakes — DeepCode identifies 10x more critical bugs and security vulnerabilities than other tools. 

## Our AI provides explanation behind found bugs

In order to show the detailed explanation of a potential bug, we introduced a new AI technique called _Ontology_. With Ontology, we’ve integrated the capability to present logical argumentation used by the DeepCode engine. 

## Supported languages and PLatforms

JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C/C++, and Python are currently supported.
